# Full Stack API Final Project
for enabling your future applications to communicate with others. 

## README

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
